## About The Project

In this project Beautiful Soup has been used to scrap data from **A**mazon, with the help of this project  we can get notified via mails, when the product price drops below the certain threshold. This is used to maintain the record of one particular amazon product that one is keen on having under a fixed price range.
It checks the price every day and updates the local csv file the same.
